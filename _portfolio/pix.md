    I developed a service that publishes an artist's portfolio as a semi-custom iPhone app. I launched several artistâ€™s apps in the iTunes App Store. 

    These screen captures show the web management application. This application is used by the artist to manage a "portfolio in the cloud" - a custom content management system ("CMS") that I wrote to house their virtual portfolio images and data files.

    <div class="inner align-center">
        <a class="example-image-link" href="/images/pix-web-home,full.png" data-lightbox="example-set" data-title="Portfolio Publisher Web App - Home">
            <img class="example-image" src="/images/pix-web-home,thumb.png" alt=""/>
        </a>
        <a class="example-image-link" href="/images/pix-web-gallery,full.png" data-lightbox="example-set" data-title="Portfolio Publisher Web App - Gallery">
            <img class="example-image" src="/images/pix-web-gallery,thumb.png" alt=""/>
        </a>
    </div>

    These screen captures show the semi-custom iPhone application. This application is used by fans of the artist to see the artist's portfolio, follow their blog, read their tweets, and communicate with the artist.
