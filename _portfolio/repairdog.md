blurb: >
    For Repair Dog, I served as the interim CTO. Working as the product owner, I drove the launch of a native iPhone app that allowed restaurant employees to manage equipment repair jobs and preferred service providers on a mobile device.  

company-description: >
    Repair Dog has launched a two sided marketplace that brings together restaurants with repair service providers. Their solution includes a mobile app for restaurant employees, a mobile app for service providers/technicians, and a web admin portal. The restaurant employee app enables users to manage a directory or preferred repair service providers, and to track critical repair jobs.  

brief-description: |
    Repair Dog is building a two sided marketplace bringing together restaurants and service providers. The company CEO/founder is a successful restauranteur who lacks experience building a technology-backed business.

    I served as interim CTO to the CEO. I helped the CEO realign his go to market strategy with the product roadmap to ensure that the business development activities would support and be supported by the product launch schedule. A two sided marketplace is the most difficult kind of business model - it requires buyers and sellers to find value in the marketplace. If there are no buyers, then sellers leave. If there are no sellers, then buyers leave.

    I proposed and executed a strategy that ensured  restaurant users (buyers) would find value using the app before service providers (sellers) were available in the marketplace. This allowed the company to launch the restaurant app several months in advance of launching the service provider app, and to build up a large base of potential buyers that would attract sellers.

    Here are some screen shots from the restaurant application:
