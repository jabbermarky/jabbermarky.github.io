## I focus on outcomes.

What outcomes are you focusing on? If you are in the business of producing and selling a software product, then you are focused on getting your product into your customer's hands.

That's where I come in. I help small and emerging businesses produce software products.

I have been producing commercial-grade software products for 30 years. In those years, I have learned what it takes to ship a new product.

I focus on what's required to get the product out the door. This requires careful editing of the feature wish list. It requires careful prioritization of what needs to be in V1 and what can wait until V2. It requires making hard choices that will make it possible to get the product into your customer's hands. Do you have a prioritized list of User Stories ready for a development team to implement?
