Outsourcing vendor, with experience would be best to validate success metrics. At the end of the day, transparency in engagement always pays.

### Consider using third-party (possibly domestic) sources to assist with the requirements phase and testing phase of the project. 

### Use third-party independent reviewers to review documents for completeness, clarity, accuracy, and (for requirements) testability. 

### Train the organization, or make sure they are fully competent to begin with.
