        <p>Your business demands more of your time and attention as it grows.
          You may eventually find that you are a bottleneck and have trouble
          making product decisions in a timely manner.</p>
        <p>You need someone you trust implicitly that can drive your
          product strategy with all the attention that it requires. You need to
          implement product management.</p>
        <p>But building a product management culture and hiring your first
          product manager is challenging.</p>

        <h2>I have spent the last 6 months interviewing companies about product management</h2>
      </header>
      <p>People have told me how they define and measure success (and avoid
        failure) in their product teams. This information is invaluable to anyone
        who wants to introduce product management into their business.
      </p>
      <p>But where do you start? I suggest that we start by defining Product Management.</p>
      <h3>What is Product Management?</h3>
      <p>Product Management is different in every organization, but the goals are the same:
        <ul>
          <li>to discover the unmet needs of customers in a market, and </li>
          <li>to deliver solutions that address those needs</li>
          <li>while meeting the objectives of the business</li>
        </ul>
        At this high level, it sounds simple. Let's dig in a little to get a
        better understanding of the complexities.
      </p>
      <h4>Discovery</h4>
      <p>Discovery is that part of Product Management where you continuously observe
        your market, your customer, your business environment, and your competition to discover
        the unmet needs of your target customer. <!--This is not a process or stage, but should
        be ongoing continuously, informing the definition of your products and services
        with new insights.-->
      </p>
      <h4>Delivery</h4>
      <p>Delivery is that part of Product Management where you translate needs and
        insights into features, and user stories and feed them to a
        product development team to produce your business' offerings.
      </p>
      <h4>Business Objectives</h4>
      <p>The Business Objectives are different based on where your company and
        product is in its lifecycle, but they typically address financial (revenue, profit, cost)
        and market adoption (% penetration, # of users).
      </p>
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>The challenges to achieving success are too numerous to address here
        (I have collected a list of more than 200 challenges!). Here are some to consider.
      </p>
      <h4>What to Work On</h4>
      <p>How do you craft a roadmap and prioritize the work so that it aligns with the company's goals?
        How do you handle changing priorities and squeaky wheels?
        What do you do with all of that user feedback?
      </p>
      <h4>Product Manager Role</h4>
      <p>What is the proper role of a product manager in your product team?
        Do they have the authority to make critical business decisions?
        Do they help develop and articulate your product strategy?
        Do they decide which features get implemented and in what order?
      </p>
      <h4>Discovery</h4>
      <p>
        How much time do you spend interacting with your customer? Are you getting out of the building enough?
        How do you leverage your insights?
      </p>
      <h4>Process</h4>
      <p>
        How do product managers thrive in an agile environment?
        Do you follow a name-brand product management framework? Are you using the right tools and systems?

            <h2>Implementing Product Management</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Before you hire your first product manager, please consider the following.</p>
        <h3>Your organization may not be ready for Product Management</h3><p>
          Many of the challenges I uncovered are cultural and fall outside of the control of the product manager.
          Successful product management will change the way the business builds
          and launches products. The people, processes, and systems in your
          organization may not be ready for that change.
        </p>
        <h3>This a process, not an event</h3>
        <p>Let's face it in
          most small companies the first product manager is actually one of the
          founders. The first product is like their baby. You wouldn't hand your
          baby to a complete stranger would you? You need to trust the product manager
          implicitly, so your process must account for some
          sort of transition or handoff period to allow trust to be earned. In fact,
          many of the people that I interviewed actually suggested promoting
          someone internally rather than hiring externally.
        </p>
        <h3>Product Management is not an undergraduate degree</h3><p>A recent study
          determined that only 2% of product managers had any formal training.
          Whatever process you follow, you need to account for some training,
          coaching or mentoring to ensure that your product manager develops the
          skills necessary to succeed in the job.
