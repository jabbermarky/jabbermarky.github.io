        <h2>Would you like to know the current product management challenges in business?</h2>
      </header>
      <!--p>People have told me how they define and measure success (and avoid
        failure) in their product teams. This information is invaluable to anyone
        who wants to introduce product management into their business.
      </p-->
      <p>Before we identify the challenges, let's start by defining Product Management.</p>
      <h3>What is Product Management?</h3>
      <p>Product Management may be different across organizations, but the goals are the same:
        <ul>
          <li>To discover the unmet needs of customers in a market</li>
          <li>To deliver solutions that address those needs</li>
          <li>To meet the objectives and key results of the business</li>
        </ul>
        At this high level, it sounds simple. Let's dig in a little to get a
        better understanding of the complexities.
      </p>
      <h4>Discovery</h4>
      <p>Discovery is that part of Product Management where you continuously observe
        your market, your customer, your business environment, and your competition to discover
        the unmet needs of your target customer. <!--This is not a process or stage, but should
        be ongoing continuously, informing the definition of your products and services
        with new insights.-->
      </p>
      <h4>Delivery</h4>
      <p>Delivery is that part of Product Management where you translate needs and
        insights into features, and user stories and feed them to a
        product development team to produce your business' offerings.
      </p>
      <h4>OKRs - Objectives and Key Results</h4>
      <p>Business objectives differ based on where a company and
        product is in its lifecycle. Typically the objectives will address financial (revenue, profit, cost)
        and market adoption (% penetration, # of users).
      </p>
      <h3>What are The Challenges?</h3>
      <p>The challenges to achieving success are too numerous to address here
        (I have collected a list of more than 200 challenges!). Here are some to consider:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Who owns the product vision, strategy and goals?</li>
        <li>What is the proper role and authority of a product manager in your product team?</li>
        <li>How do you craft a roadmap and prioritize features to align with your company's goals?</li>
        <li>How much time do you spend with your customer - do you get out of the building?</li>
        <li>What do you do with all of that user feedback?</li>
        <li>How do you handle changing priorities and squeaky wheels?</li>
        <li>Are you using processes, tools and systems?</li>
        <li>Which product management framework should you embrace?</li>
      </li>
    </ul>

            <h2>Implementing Product Management</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Before you hire your first product manager, please consider the following:</p>
        <h3>Your organization may not be ready for Product Management</h3><p>
          Many of the challenges are cultural and fall outside of the control of the product manager.
          Successful product management will change the way the business builds
          and launches products. The people, processes, and systems in your
          organization may not be ready for that change.
        </p>
        <h3>This a process, not an event</h3>
        <p>Let's face it - in
          most small companies the first product manager is actually one of the
          founders and the first product is very important to them. It's like their baby.
          You wouldn't hand your
          baby to a complete stranger, would you? You need to trust the product manager
          implicitly. Your process must account for some
          sort of transition or handoff period to allow trust to be earned. In fact,
          many of the people that I interviewed actually suggested promoting
          someone internally rather than hiring externally.
        </p>
        <h3>Product Management is not something learned in school.</h3>
        <p>A recent study
          determined that only 2% of product managers have any formal training.
          Whatever process you follow needs to account for training,
          coaching, or mentoring to ensure that your product manager develops the
          skills necessary to succeed in the job.
